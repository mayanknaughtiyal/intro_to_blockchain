# IPFS(INTERPLANETORY FILE SYSTEM)
# IPFS: What You Need to Know
# What is IPFS?
## The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized and distributed file storage system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. It stands out from traditional file storage methods due to its unique way of storing and accessing files, directories, websites, and data. It’s a popular type of web3 storage that uses peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, making it akin to a single BitTorrent swarm for exchanging objects within one Git repository.

# How is content organized on IPFS?
## How It’s Stored:
### **In IPFS, files and other data are stored in a network of nodes. These nodes are essentially computers participating in the IPFS network, each storing only a portion of the entire data. When a file is added to IPFS, it is split into ### smaller blocks, hashed, and given a unique fingerprint called a cryptographic hash.**

## How It’s Retrieved:
### **To retrieve data, a user requests it using the hash. IPFS locates the nodes storing the corresponding blocks and downloads them. This decentralized approach means that content can be served faster and more reliably, as it does not rely on a single point of failure.**

## Understanding Location Addressing vs Content Addressing: 
### **Traditional web uses location-based addressing, where content is accessed by its location on a server (URL). IPFS uses content-based addressing, where content is accessed by a hash of its content. This ensures that as long as the content remains the same, its address does not change, regardless of where it’s stored.**
